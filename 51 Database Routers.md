# Database routers

A database Router is a class that provides up to four methods:

1. db_for_read() - Suggest the database that should be used for read operations for objects of type model.
2. db_for_write() - Suggest the database that should be used for writes of objects of type Model.
3. allow_relation() - Return True if a relation between obj1 and obj2 should be allowed, False if the relation should be prevented, or None if the router has no opinion.
4. allow_migrate() - Determine if the migration operation is allowed to run on the database with alias db. Return True if the operation should run, False if it shouldnâ€™t run, or None if the router has no opinion.

```python
class AppRouter:
    default_db = "default"
    sqlite_db = "sqlite"
    related_models = [Pizza, Topping]

    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        if model in self.related_models:
            return self.sqlite_db
        return None

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        if model in self.related_models:
            return self.sqlite_db
        return None
```
