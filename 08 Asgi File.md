# ASGI File

Similar to WSGI Responsible For Create Server as a asysnchronous approach.

The application object is used by the ASGI-compatible web servers to communicate with your project. ASGI application is defined in the asgi.py file generated by the startproject management command in the project root directory. This works analogously to the WSGI application defined for WSGI-compatible web servers in the wsgi.py.

*Daphne*

Daphne is a pure-Python ASGI server that supports HTTP/1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets. Itâ€™s written and maintained under the wing of the Django organization which is a big plus from a long-term support perspective. It should be maintained as long as Django exists.
