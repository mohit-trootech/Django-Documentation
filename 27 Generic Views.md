# Generic Views: Less Code is Better

The detail(), and results() views are very short – and, as mentioned above, redundant. The index() view, which displays a list of polls, is similarly short,

These views represent a common case of basic web development: getting data from the database according to a parameter passed in the URL, loading a template and returning the rendered template. Because this is so common, Django provides a shortcut, called the “generic views” system.

Generic views abstract common patterns to the point where you don’t even need to write Python code to write an app. For example, the ListView and DetailView generic views abstract the concepts of “display a list of objects” and “display a detail page for a particular type of object” respectively.

## Firstly, Update the urls for corresponding views

    from django.urls import path

    from . import views

    app_name = "polls"
    urlpatterns = [
        path("", views.IndexView.as_view(), name="index"),
        path("<int:pk>/", views.DetailView.as_view(), name="detail"),
        path("<int:pk>/results/", views.ResultsView.as_view(), name="results"),
        path("<int:question_id>/vote/", views.vote, name="vote"),
    ]

`polls/views.py`

    from django.db.models import F
    from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
    from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render
    from django.urls import reverse
    from django.views import generic

    from .models import Choice, Question

    class IndexView(generic.ListView):
        template_name = "polls/index.html"
        context_object_name = "latest_question_list"

        def get_queryset(self):
            """Return the last five published questions."""
            return Question.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]

    class DetailView(generic.DetailView):
        model = Question
        template_name = "polls/detail.html"

    class ResultsView(generic.DetailView):
        model = Question
        template_name = "polls/results.html"

    def vote(request, question_id):
        # same as above, no changes needed.
        ...

### The ListView

ListView generic view uses a default template called `<app name>/<model name>`_list.html; we use template_name to tell ListView to use our existing "polls/index.html" template

### The DetailView

DetailView generic view uses a template called `<app name>/<model name>`_detail.html. In our case, it would use the template "polls/question_detail.html". The template_name attribute is used to tell Django to use a specific template name instead of the autogenerated default template name. We also specify the template_name for the results list view – this ensures that the results view and the detail view have a different appearance when rendered, even though they’re both a DetailView behind the scenes
