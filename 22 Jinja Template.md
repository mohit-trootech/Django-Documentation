# Templates

Being a web framework, Django needs a convenient way to generate HTML dynamically. The most common approach relies on templates. A template contains the static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.

Django ships built-in backends for its own template system, creatively called the Django template language (DTL), and for the popular alternative Jinja2. Backends for other template languages may be available from third-parties.

## The Django template language

A Django template is a text document or a Python string marked-up using the Django template language. Some constructs are recognized and interpreted by the template engine. The main ones are variables and tags.

A template is rendered with a context. Rendering replaces variables with their values, which are looked up in the context, and executes tags. Everything else is output as is.

The syntax of the Django template language involves four constructs.

### Variables

A variable outputs a value from the context, which is a dict-like object mapping keys to values.

Variables are surrounded by `{{` and `}}` like this:

My first name is `{{ first_name }}`. My last name is `{{ last_name }}`.

With a context of {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Doe'}, this template renders to:

    My first name is John. My last name is Doe.

***Dictionary lookup, attribute lookup and list-index lookups are implemented with a dot notation:***

{{ my_dict.key }}
{{ my_object.attribute }}
{{ my_list.0 }}
If a variable resolves to a callable, the template system will call it with no arguments and use its result instead of the callable.

### Tags

Tags provide arbitrary logic in the rendering process.

This definition is deliberately vague. For example, a tag can output content, serve as a control structure e.g. an « if » statement or a « for » loop, grab content from a database, or even enable access to other template tags.

Tags are surrounded by {% and %} like this:

`{% csrf_token %}`

Most tags accept arguments:

`{% cycle 'odd' 'even' %}`

Some tags require beginning and ending tags:

`{% if user.is_authenticated %}Hello, {{ user.username }}.{% endif %}`
A reference of built-in tags is available as well as instructions for writing custom tags.

### Filters

Filters transform the values of variables and tag arguments.

They look like this:

`{{ django|title }}`
With a context of {'django': 'the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines'}, this template renders to:

    The Web Framework For Perfectionists With Deadlines

Some filters take an argument:

`{{ my_date|date:"Y-m-d" }}`

A reference of built-in filters is available as well as instructions for writing custom filters.

### Comments¶

Comments look like this:

`{# this won't be rendered #}`

A {% comment %} tag provides multi-line comments.

### Configuration

Templates engines are configured with the TEMPLATES setting. It’s a list of configurations, one for each engine. The default value is empty. The `settings.py` generated by the startproject command defines a more useful value:

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            "BACKEND": "django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates",
            "DIRS": [],
            "APP_DIRS": True,
            "OPTIONS": {
                # ... some options here ...
            },
        },
    ]
BACKEND is a dotted Python path to a template engine class implementing Django’s template backend API. The built-in backends are django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates and django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2.

Since most engines load templates from files, the top-level configuration for each engine contains two common settings:
